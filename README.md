### Task Complition Guide
 -Implement each task in separate branch.
Branch naming starts with the number of tasks in Jira and continued with brief naming, referring to the name of task. Example: sip-255-fr-1.7-repo-four-BGroups for task:  SIP-255 FR 1.7 - Create repository for “BGroups”.

 - After work is done create pull request into dev
 - Name pull request similar to the task name. 
Example: FR 1.7 - Create repository for “BGroups”
 - Add the reference to task in Jira into description of request. Also In the description of the task in Jira reference to pull request.

 - Write request to review in telegram and add ref to pull request.
 
 - Create task for testing in the backlog

 - Until request will be approved by Architect and some one from Devs it cant be merged
